# TFT-display-with-raspberry-pico
This project is intended to be used with the raspberryi pi pico and  tft display. 
The tft display used in this project is a 2inch LCD Module with 240x340 Pixels.
The drivers for the display is the ST7789V. 
I plan on using code from Adafruit as they have already configured and created packages for this driver. 
This will be updated as needed.
